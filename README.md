# Overview
A script to scan URLs for CRLF injection vulnerabilities. This tool tests each URL with a specific payload and checks for vulnerabilities by examining the response headers.

# Features
User-Agent Rotation: Mimics different browsers to reduce detection.

Concurrent Scanning: Scans multiple URLs simultaneously for faster results.

Custom Payload: Identifies vulnerabilities using a specific CRLF payload.

Detailed Logging: Logs the scanning process and results clearly.

# Installation
git clone https://github.com/ManShum812/ReflectedXSS-Finder.git

cd ReflectedXSS-Finder

go build main.go

# How to Use
1. Prepare Input File: Create a file named input.txt with the URLs you want to scan.

2. Run the Script: python crlf.py

3. Check the Output: Results are saved in output.txt.

# Notes
This script uses a custom payload (%23%0d%0a2222:param=1111) to test for CRLF vulnerabilities by checking if the response header matches 2222:param=1111. You can modify this payload as needed.
